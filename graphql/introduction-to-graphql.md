# Introduction to GraphQL

### Querying transaction data on Arweave

As a user or developer interacting with the Arweave blockchain, there are several compelling reasons why you may need access to transaction data. For example if you're working on analytics, dApps, user interaction monitoring, verifying a transaction, smart contract interaction and the list goes on. Now accessing on-chain transactions data using REST APIs is a straight forward way to go but with GraphQL and its precise data retrieval, reduced overfetching and underfetching, batching capabilities, and real-time updates, GraphQL offers a more efficient and flexible way to interact with the Arweave blockchain. \
\
By embracing this powerful querying technology, developers can build performant and user-friendly applications, while keeping their codebase future-proof and adaptable to the evolving blockchain landscape.

In this section, we will look at the following features:

* Querying GraphQL endpoint for any Arweave supported blockchain data
* Querying for transactions with GraphQL and cursor based pagination
* Querying for all transactions with GraphQL iteratively
