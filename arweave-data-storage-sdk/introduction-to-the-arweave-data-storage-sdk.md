# Introduction to the Arweave Data Storage SDK

The **Arweave Data Storage SDK** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to easily store any type of data permanently, facilitating seamless file and folder management on the Arweave blockchain. It leverages Arweave's decentralized permanent storage capabilities and ArFS specification to offer a robust solution for managing drives, folders, and files in a secure and immutable manner. With built-in encryption support, Arweave Data Storage SDK allows you to store files privately ensuring only authorized parties can access the content.

For seamless data storage and retrieval on [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), use the [`Arweave Data Storage SDK`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arweave-storage-sdk) .

**Documentation**

The SDK is structured around several key services and models that produce Arweave compatible transactions:

* **Drives** – Create, list, and manage Arweave Data Storage SDK’s drives.
* **Folders** – Organize files in a hierarchical folder system.
* **Files** – Create, download, and manage file data.
* **Query** – Get uploaded file links, search for files using tags.

**Requirements**

* Node 18 or higher

_The library makes use of modern JavaScript/TypeScript features that require at least Node 18._
