# Features

The following are some of the ideas we're exploring as potential features we'd like to add to the library. We have set up a discussion page on the Github Repo. Feel free to add to these ideas or make suggestions as to what you think would be great features to potentially add to the library. You can find the discussion page [here](https://github.com/labscommunity/permawebjs/discussions)

### GraphQL

* Support for GraphQL has been added as of July 28, 2023. You can view the docs for the same [here](../graphql/introduction-to-graphql.md).

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

* Ability to run the functions in a command line interface&#x20;

```
$ permawebjs function:createWallet --seedPhrase --environment=local
```

### Plugin System

* The Arweave Ecosystem has a lot of tools. A plugin system would allow these tools to be integrated to permawebjs as plugins
